Exploratory data analysis of crime rates over time
Identifying trends and changes in different crime types
The data could be valuable for law enforcement agencies, researchers, analysts, and others interested in understanding crime dynamics at regional and national levels in the U.S.

Limitations exist around accuracy and under-reporting of certain crime types. Care should be taken in interpreting the data and drawing conclusions. Further context from qualitative sources would complement this quantitative dataset.
